# Fixture provenance

`claude-*`, `codex-*`, `cursor-*`, `gemini-*`, `opencode-*` and `pi-*`
screens without a `working` suffix are copied from herdr-projects
(`tests/fixtures/prompt_box/`), and the detection logic in `../promptbox.go`
and `../trust.go` is ported from its `src/prompt_box.rs` and
`src/trust_screen.rs`:

`claude-working*.ansi` were captured from Claude Code 2.1.283 in Herdr 0.9.1
(`herdr agent read --source visible --format ansi`) while the agent was
working, with a queued prompt, and with an unsent draft.
